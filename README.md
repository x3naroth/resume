### Summary
Since I was a child, I always wanted to understand why things are the way they are, and that curiosity led me to study physics. As a passionate physics student, I have a natural ability to analyze complex problems and find optimal solutions. My curious mind constantly drives me to acquire new knowledge that can be applied to professional development, work projects, and everyday life. I particularly value effective communication in teamwork, as this skill optimizes project performance, product value, and individual growth.

### Featured Projects
- **Models for early diabetes prediction** - Machine learning models and neural networks were used to predict potential diabetic patients for early diagnosis and treatment, based on blood test and triage data collection [Summary](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kfmjdgbmcfrq)/[Repository](https://github.com/x3naroth/Diabetes_prediction.git)
- **Specific Charge of the electron** - The specific charge of the electron was determined through two different analyses. Gnuplot was used to make linear regressions and gaussian curves fitting. [Research document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vnwqjrqswrdv)
- **Rest energy of the electron through Compton effect** - The rest energy of an electron was determined using the Compton equation for collision with a photon, using an X-ray emitter generated by a Carbon scatterer. Gnuplot was used to make linear regressions and plotting the results [Research document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nhnzbpwxpznd)
