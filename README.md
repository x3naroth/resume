### Summary
Since I was a child, I always wanted to understand why things are the way they are, and that curiosity led me to study physics. As a passionate physics student, I have a natural ability to analyze complex problems and find optimal solutions. My curious mind constantly drives me to acquire new knowledge that can be applied to professional development, work projects, and everyday life. I particularly value effective communication in teamwork, as this skill optimizes project performance, product value, and individual growth.

## Work Experience
**Contractor 2023** - _Ferreyro LLC_ 
- User Interface   was classified in either functional or non-functional given its design, using Google's Inception V3 pre-trained model, with a final precision of 79% and recall of 92%. An API was deployed to be able to take input files from a webpage to make predictions. 
 
**Bank manager assistant 2010 - 2017** - _Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (Public Bank)_
- Assisting the Manager's agenda, setting up software for enterprises,  loan scoring validation. Providing several financial solutions for customers needs. Helped to make my branch the number one in sales in my region in 2016.

### Featured Projects
- **Models for early diabetes prediction** - Machine learning models and neural networks were used to predict potential diabetic patients for early diagnosis and treatment, based on blood test and triage data collection, getting recall and precision metrics above 93% [Summary](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kfmjdgbmcfrq)/[Repository](https://github.com/x3naroth/Diabetes_prediction.git)
- **Models for early diabetes prediction** - Machine learning models and neural networks were used to predict potential diabetic patients for early diagnosis and treatment, based on blood test and triage data collection, getting recall and precision metrics above 93%.
- **Sentiment analysis** - Data scraping was performed on several medical articles posts in order to perform sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.
- **Chatbot** - PyPDF2 and transformers were used to build a chatbot that answers questions from loaded pdfs. 
- **Fraudulent transactions detection** - LSTM model was used to detect fraudulent transactions, where 56% of the fraudulent transactions were predicted in the test set, at the expense of 7% of the non fraudulent transactions being misclassified.
- **Customers flow** - Users flow was studied using SARIMA and LSTM looking for ways to increase the amount of users that purchase a subscription to the website according to region and time projection.
